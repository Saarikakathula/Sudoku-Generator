# Sudoku Generator
## What is Sudoku?
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle played on a 9-by-9 grid, which is divided into nine smaller 3-by-3 subgrids, or "boxes." The goal is to fill the entire grid so that each row, column, and box contains the numbers 1 through 9, with no repeats.
## What are the 3 rules of Sudoku?
1. *Each row contains unique numbers:* Every number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row.
2. *Each column contains unique numbers:* Every number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each column.
3. *Each 3x3 subgrid (block) contains unique numbers:* The 9x9 Sudoku grid is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, and each subgrid contains every number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- During puzzle generation these are the standard rules of a Sudoku puzzle, which ensure that the board is valid.

## Code Summary
- This Python code generates a randomized Sudoku puzzle and displays it in a nicely formatted grid,
- then removes some values to create an incomplete puzzle that the user can solve.This code can be used to generate and display randomized Sudoku puzzles, which can then be solved manually or using an algorithm.
### Note
- Backtracking is not used in this code. The code generates a complete Sudoku puzzle by constructing it from a valid pattern and then randomly shuffling the rows, columns, and numbers. It ensures that the puzzle is valid from the start by following Sudoku rules during generation.

- Backtracking is typically a recursive algorithm used to solve puzzles by trying different possibilities and reverting (backtracking) when a conflict arises.
 However, in this code, there is no attempt to solve the puzzle or handle conflicts. It simply generates a valid board and then removes some of the numbers to create an incomplete puzzle.

## Instructions for use
To generate and play a Sudoku puzzle:
- Run the Python script in your preferred environment.
- The script will generate a complete Sudoku puzzle, display it, and then remove some numbers to create a challenge.
- You can manually solve the puzzle, or enhance the code with a solving algorithm if needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm.
- Generate puzzles of varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
- Customize the grid size for different Sudoku variations like 4x4 or 16x16.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
This Sudoku generator is a simple yet effective way to create randomized Sudoku puzzles for practice or play. 
While the current version doesn't include a solving mechanism, it can be extended to include a solver or other enhancements to improve the user experience. 
It's a great project for anyone interested in understanding how Sudoku puzzles work and how to generate them programmatically.
